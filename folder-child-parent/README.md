# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This code creates a folder tree component in React that renders a list of folders and subfolders with checkboxes. When a user selects a folder, all of its child folders will be selected as well, and vice versa.

The initialFolders array contains an array of objects representing the initial folder tree structure. Each object has an id, a name, and a children property, which is an array of child folders.

The FolderTree component receives the folders prop and renders each folder recursively by calling the renderFolder function. The renderFolder function renders the checkbox for the folder and its name, and if it has children, it calls itself recursively to render each child folder.

When a user selects a folder, the handleFolderSelect function is called with the folderId and whether it's selected or not. It creates a new array newSelectedFolders with the current selected folders, adds or removes the selected folder's id depending on whether it was selected or deselected, and updates the state with the new selected folders using setSelectedFolders.

If the selected folder has children, the function loops through each child folder and adds or removes their id from newSelectedFolders as well, based on whether the parent folder was selected or deselected.

Finally, the function checks if the selected folder has children and loops through each child folder to check if they are all selected or not. If all of the child folders are selected, the function selects the parent folder as well.

The App component renders the FolderTree component with the initialFolders array as a prop.
